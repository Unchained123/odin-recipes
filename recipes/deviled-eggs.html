    <p>Avocado, bacon, and eggs are such a great combination! This is a quick and easy way to take deviled eggs to a new level! 
        I won't make them without avocado! It adds so much taste and texture. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bacon (or smoked bacon), trimmed of fat and cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 avocado, halved and pitted</li>
        <li>6 hard-boiled eggs, halved</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 splash lime juice</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Step by step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, 
            until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>

            mayonnaise, mustard, and lime juice.</li>
